Same bugs fixed in the tree component, lazy mode
1) append node (insertChild)
 a) fixed ISSUE 11346. - added condition !this.store.lazy to  if (!batch && !this.store.lazy) ...
 b) Since the new node does not require loading, was changed intital state for created not isLeaf node to
    loaded = true
    expanded = true 
 c) to append method of tree component
   - added new parameter - callback
   - added auto expand parent node 
2) Dragdrop (tree-node-drag-end)
 a) Dragdrop to collapsed node - to load dropNode children before drop events, was added dropNode.node.expand
 b) since in the lazy mode the node.data does not contain information about children, insertNode method uses node object  instead node.data.
3) node updateChildren - no node.data.children in the lazy mode
4) added method close(node) to tree component, it set node.loaded = false
  In large trees it is sometimes advantageous to transfer nodes to an unloaded state.

  Now it's easy to update the node: 
  node.close()
  node.expand()
