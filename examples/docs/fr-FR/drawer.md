## Drawer

Sometimes, `Dialog` does not always satisfy our requirements, let's say you have a massive form, or you need space to display something like `terms & conditions`, `Drawer` has almost identical API with `Dialog`, but it introduces different user experience.

### Basic Usage

Callout a temporary drawer, from multiple direction

:::demo You must set `visible` for `Drawer` like `Dialog` does to control the visibility of `Drawer` itself, it's `boolean` type. `Drawer` has to parts: `title` & `body`, the `title` is a named slot, you can also set the title through attribute named `title`, default to an empty string, the `body` part is the main area of `Drawer`, which contains user defined content. When opening, `Drawer` expand itself from the **right corner to left** which size is **30%** of the browser window by default. You can change that default behavior by setting `direction` and `size` attribute. This show case also demonstrated how to use the `before-close` API, check the Attribute section for more detail

```html
<el-radio-group v-model="direction">
  <el-radio label="ltr">left to right</el-radio>
  <el-radio label="rtl">right to left</el-radio>
  <el-radio label="ttb">top to bottom</el-radio>
  <el-radio label="btt">bottom to top</el-radio>
</el-radio-group>

<el-button @click="drawer = true" type="primary" style="margin-left: 16px;">
  open
</el-button>

<el-drawer
  title="I am the title"
  :visible.sync="drawer"
  :direction="direction"
  :before-close="handleClose">
  <span>Hi, there!</span>
</el-drawer>

<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        drawer: false,
        direction: 'rtl',
      };
    },
    methods: {
      handleClose(done) {
        this.$confirm('Are you sure you want to close this?')
          .then(_ => {
            done();
          })
          .catch(_ => {});
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```

### Customization Content

Like `Dialog`, `Drawer` can do many diverse interaction as you wanted.

:::demo

```html
<el-button type="text" @click="table = true">Open Drawer with nested table</el-button>
<el-button type="text" @click="dialog = true">Open Drawer with nested form</el-button>
<el-drawer
  title="I have a nested table inside!"
  :visible.sync="table"
  direction="rtl"
  size="50%">
   <el-table :data="gridData">
      <el-table-column property="date" label="Date" width="150"></el-table-column>
      <el-table-column property="name" label="Name" width="200"></el-table-column>
      <el-table-column property="address" label="Address"></el-table-column>
    </el-table>
</el-drawer>

<el-drawer
  title="I have a nested form inside!"
  :before-close="handleClose"
  :visible.sync="dialog"
  direction="ltr"
  custom-class="demo-drawer"
  ref="drawer"
  >
  <div class="demo-drawer__content">
    <el-form :model="form">
      <el-form-item label="Name" :label-width="formLabelWidth">
        <el-input v-model="form.name" autocomplete="off"></el-input>
      </el-form-item>
      <el-form-item label="Area" :label-width="formLabelWidth">
        <el-select v-model="form.region" placeholder="Please select activity area">
          <el-option label="Area1" value="shanghai"></el-option>
          <el-option label="Area2" value="beijing"></el-option>
        </el-select>
      </el-form-item>
    </el-form>
    <div class="demo-drawer__footer">
      <el-button @click="dialog = false">Cancel</el-button>
      <el-button type="primary" @click="$refs.drawer.closeDrawer()" :loading="loading">{{ loading ? 'Submitting ...' : 'Submit' }}</el-button>
    </div>
  </div>
</el-drawer>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      table: false,
      dialog: false,
      loading: false,
      gridData: [{
        date: '2016-05-02',
        name: 'Peter Parker',
        address: 'Queens, New York City'
      }, {
        date: '2016-05-04',
        name: 'Peter Parker',
        address: 'Queens, New York City'
      }, {
        date: '2016-05-01',
        name: 'Peter Parker',
        address: 'Queens, New York City'
      }, {
        date: '2016-05-03',
        name: 'Peter Parker',
        address: 'Queens, New York City'
      }],
      form: {
        name: '',
        region: '',
        date1: '',
        date2: '',
        delivery: false,
        type: [],
        resource: '',
        desc: ''
      },
      formLabelWidth: '80px'
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleClose(done) {
      this.$confirm('Do you want to submit?')
        .then(_ => {
          this.loading = true;
          setTimeout(() => {
            this.loading = false;
            done();
          }, 2000);
        })
        .catch(_ => {});
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

### Nested Drawer

You can also have multiple layer of `Drawer` just like `Dialog`.
:::demo If you need multiple Drawer in different layer, you must set the `append-to-body` attribute to **true**

```html

<el-button @click="drawer = true" type="primary" style="margin-left: 16px;">
  open
</el-button>

<el-drawer
  title="I'm outer Drawer"
  :visible.sync="drawer"
  size="50%">
  <div>
   <el-button @click="innerDrawer = true">Click me!</el-button>
   <el-drawer
     title="I'm inner Drawer"
     :append-to-body="true"
     :before-close="handleClose"
     :visible.sync="innerDrawer">
     <p>_(:зゝ∠)_</p>
   </el-drawer>
  </div>
</el-drawer>

<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        drawer: false,
        innerDrawer: false,
      };
    },
    methods: {
      handleClose(done) {
        this.$confirm('You still have unsaved data, proceed?')
          .then(_ => {
            done();
          })
          .catch(_ => {});
      }
    }
  };
</script>

```
:::

:::tip

The content inside Drawer should be lazy rendered, which means that the content inside Drawer will not impact the initial render performance, therefore any DOM operation should be performed through `ref` or after `open` event emitted.

:::

:::tip

Drawer provides an API called `destroyOnClose`, which is a flag variable that indicates should destroy the children content inside Drawer after Drawer was closed. You can use this API when you need your `mounted` life cycle to be called every time the Drawer opens.

:::

:::tip

If the variable bound to `visible` is managed in Vuex store, the `.sync` can not work properly. In this case, please remove the `.sync` modifier, listen to `open` and `close` events of Dialog, and commit Vuex mutations to update the value of that variable in the event handlers.
